## Welcome to POLI 273

Welcome to the couse website of POLI 273 Causal Inference. In this
course, we survey most commonly used empirical tools for political
science and public policy research. Our focus is design-based causal
inference, that is, to use statistical methods to answer research
questions that concern the impact of some cause on certain outcomes.

We are delighted to present class preojects by our students.
